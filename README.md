# “WTWR” (a near-acronym for "What to Wear")

Welcome to a project demonstration called WTWR!

first phase:

An application's front-end built from scratch excercising HTML, CSS, and Javascript with additonal functionality to the React front-end, serving the fundamentals of the javascript framework.
I will also be exhibiting the core piece of the application's functionality: interaction with the weather API. Using the asynchronous fetch requests I learned in the previous sprint, I make requests to this API. The response will include location-specific weather data, which will be parsed and utilized to filter out clothing cards unsuitable for the current weather.

Technologies and techniques used in this project includes:
-The basics of React
-How to build React apps with Create React App
-Modern React syntax, called hooks
-Understanding and correctly using the this keyword

# React + Vite “WTWR” (a near-acronym for "What to Wear")

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

second phase:

My goal for this iteration is to continue implementing functionality using the React features I have learned. I implement the following:

A temperature unit toggle switch using React context
A profile page route using React Router
Form submission using controlled components or refs

third phase:

My goal for this phase is to implement authentication and authorization working with React front-end and backend functionality by implementing:
protection routes, registration, log-in, and user token features.
